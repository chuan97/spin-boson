The variational Polaron transformation for the spin-boson model gives a variational ansatz defined some variables $f_k$. The value of $f_k$ is defined by a self-consistent equation that can be solved iteratively with the fixed-point method. Here we implement that method for two different scenarios depending on whether gauge invariance is imposed or not (this manifests in the presence or absence of the $P^2$ term). We then test the differences between the two cases.
